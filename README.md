# Python example code for running an ECG Classifier

## How do I run these scripts?

type 

    python CNN_Model.py

in a command line tool.
Then you will be asked to write the path to your data. This should look something like this:
    ./my/path/
And finaly you will be asked to provide the path to the scored SNOMED codes. This should look similar to this:
    ./my/other/path/dx_mapping_scored.csv

Make sure to make a folder called "models" in the root folder in order to be able to store models and weights.
